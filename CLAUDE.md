# CLAUDE.md

## Claude tooling for this repo

Global commands (`.claude/commands/`) and skills (`.claude/skills/`) vendored from `ksdisch/claude-config` via `/claudify-repo`, so they work in cloud/web sessions and for collaborators. ✅ = cloud-safe (pure reasoning + repo edits). 💻 = **local-only** — needs local tools (browser MCP, Chrome, local TTS/voice, or the local `nlm` CLI / NotebookLM MCP) and will NOT work in a cloud/web session.

### Commands

- ✅ `/handoff` — generate a paste-ready handoff prompt for a fresh session; captures lessons + plan state.
- ✅ `/tdd` — test-first loop: write failing tests, confirm they fail for the right reason, commit, then code until green without touching the tests.

## Project Wiki

This project uses the project-wiki skill. When integrating new sources, recording decisions, or pausing work:
- Update `PROJECT.md` status and next actions
- Update `HANDOFF.md` with what changed and what's next
- Add durable understanding to `Wiki/` topic pages
- Record decisions in `Decisions.md`
- Keep `Wiki/_index.md` current

(`Wiki/`, `Decisions.md`, and `Sources.md` are created on first need — templates live in the skill.)

Invoke the `project-wiki` skill when wiki updates are needed.
